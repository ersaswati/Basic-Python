🏁 One-Line Answer ⭐

A static method is a function inside a class that does not access instance or class data and is used for utility or helper logic.

📊 Comparison Table b/w static method and normal Method

| Feature                   | Normal Method | Static Method |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Uses `self`               | ✅             | ❌          |
| Access instance variables | ✅             | ❌          |
| Belongs to object         | ✅             | ❌          |
| Multiprocessing safe      | ⚠️            | ✅           |
| Logical grouping          | ⚠️            | ✅           |

🎯 When SHOULD you use @staticmethod?
Use it when:
1> Logic does not depend on object state
2> Function is reusable
3> You want clean structure
4> Using multiprocessing / threading

🎯 @staticmethod vs @classmethod ⭐
@staticmethod
A static method is a utility function inside a class that does not access class or instance data.

@classmethod
A class method receives the class as an argument and is used to work with class-level data or create alternative constructors.

👉 @classmethod respects inheritance
👉 @staticmethod does NOT

Needs class data?     → @classmethod
Needs object data?    → normal method
Needs nothing?        → @staticmethod
